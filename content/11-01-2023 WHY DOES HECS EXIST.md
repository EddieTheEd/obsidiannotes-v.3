title: "11-01-2023 WHY DOES HECS EXIST"
---

*because i love thinking about education systems*

## Context
I was out shopping with my dad talking about uni stuff then I asked "Which units cost the most?" He said he didn't know but it didn't matter. At this point I was completely unaware of the existence of HECS and questioned whether he would be fine covering the units, because I was assuming he would pay for it (sorry if this is a rich kid moment). He laughed and then told me about HECS, and included the fact that **there is a variable interest rate!**

## Clarifications
I fully support the existence of HECS. I love that it means students do not have to pay upfront for education. This makes education much more economically feasible assuming that post-university students will soon get stable income and thus be able to pay their loans off. What I disagree with is the variable interest rate. My idealised concept of HECS would be students get the loan, and they pay off the amount they receive annually, i.e. a loan with no interest. In 2002-03 the government made $1.18 billion in student loan repayments. This accounts for **0.672571429%** of the overall revenue made in 2002-03 (yes I pulled up old budget docs). 

## But why?
I can certainly see the financial incentive behind a variable interest rate for student education, but I believe that this interest rate **disencourages students**. Disencouraged students means less people with degrees. Thus less educated people filling lower-paying jobs, and in the long term economic and scientific progress is stunted. This is bad, both for government coffers and the development of our society.

## What should be done?
Remove the god damn interest rate.
