Caesura:
- Presence of full stops in the middle of a line
	- Breaks the flow of the poem + "emphasis" - Christian Choe
- Can be done via a dash, poem, etc.
	- Comma are "almost" caesura, they kinda make us pause by breaking up the steady rhythm of a poem.

Enjambment:
- The continuation of a phrase beyond the line, i.e. there is no grammar point at the end of a line
- Still keep an idea flowing
- Building tension (?)
