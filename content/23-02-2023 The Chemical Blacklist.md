title: "23-02-2023 The Chemical Blacklist"

## 1. $Al(NO_{3})_{3}$
- Reason: For being a Lewis acid
- Why blacklist: Can showed as an acid using universal indicator but formed a precipitate in the chem practical for yr 11. Confused the hell out of me, and caused me to lose marks in what would otherwise be an almost perfect assessment.

## 2. $ClO_{2}$
- Reason: for existing
- Why blacklist: It turns out that the substance in that funny chem yr 12 redox test was not infact $ClO_{2}^{-}$, but $ClO_{2}$. This caused me to get the multi choice question wrong. I am in eternal anger and pain. Furthermore, WHY DOES $ClO_{2}$ EXIST? WHY DOES CHLORINE HAVE AN OXIDATION NUMBER OF +4 WHAT THE HELL
