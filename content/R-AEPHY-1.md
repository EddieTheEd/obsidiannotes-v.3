## SIS Stuff in Physics
- Accuracy: how close the measurement is to the true value of the dimension being measured
	- Either accurate or not accurate. DO NOT say "reasonably"
	- $\pm 5$% of the quantity measured (from the accepted value?)
- Precision: In terms of a measuring instrument, the fineness of the scale on the instrument. In terms of experimental precision, how far apart from the average experimental value, the individual measurements are spread.
- Reliable: when the results are consistent
	- Do more trials to make it more reliable
- Validity: There is no variable affecting the investigation other than the deliberate experimentation of the independent variable and the resulting response is the dependent variable.

- Uncertainty/Error
- 3 types!!!
	- Measurement: unavoidable, property of the measuing instrument
		- Absolute error:
			- - of the instruments, = 1/2 of the smallest unit of scale on the instrument. e.g. 30cm with millimetre increments, the absolute error is $\pm$**0.5mm**
		- Percentage error:
			- %$u = \frac{absolute}{value \ measured} \times 100$
	- Systematic errors: affect the results such that all measurements are skewed away from the ideal values of the data. Not necessarily(?) by the same amount.

e.g. 3 measurements were taken:
| Measurement | Absolute Error | % Error  |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------- |
| 10cm        | 0.5mm, 0.05cm  | 0.500%     |
| 15cm        | 0.5mm, 0.05cm  | 0.333% |
| 21cm        | 0.5mm, 0.05cm  | 0.238%   |
Notice that as long as the measuring instrument is same, the absolute error is same, but the percentage error changes.
