*a sad reality*

## western australia

we are owned by the gas companies


this is sad and horrible and disgusting and completely disappointing

even the supreme governor mcgowan is owned by woodside


woodside is spreading their propaganda in education

i still remember going to some stupid woodside sponsored "innovations activity" where they basically made up some excuse for having to shift to renewable **using coal and gas**, which, while might be partially true, is most certainly *not* how woodside is actually doing it.

## woodside

woodside sends their gas overseas

their whole argument is "oh but we still need to have some energy for australia"

WELL THEN DONT SEND IT OVERSEAS

TRY NOT MAKING A MASSIVE PROFIT ONCE IN A WHILE ITS


ok im too tired, sleep-deprived, sick (physically and emotionally) and angy to do this

*With love(but not for dasindu)*
