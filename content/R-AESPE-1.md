## The idea of proof

There are different types of proof, legal, scientific/medical (experimental?), mathematical, etc.

The first two proof are **judgements** based on probability and not **absolute statements**.

i.e. for a murder case its the most likely case that the accused did the murder

In comparison a proof of Pythaogras' Theorem isn't having just a single right triangle applying or a thousand right triangles applying, as a single case that exists that disproves the theory would mean all these answer do not apply.

In math, it is a **reasoned argument** that shows such a theory is true that makes a ***proof***! :)


> [!TLDR] TLDR
> A mathematical proof is a **reasoned argument**, not an accumulation of evidence.
> Consequently, the truth of mathematical statements can be known with 100% certainty.
> A mathematical statement which has been **proved** to be true is called a **theorem**.
> A mathematical statement that is yet to be proved is called a **conjecture**.

Mathematics has a higher **standard of proof** than most disciplines

### Types of True statements

- **Axiom:** A statement that is *self-evidently true*; a building block of mathematics
	- e.g. Two straight lines intersect in at most one point.
- **Theorem:** A statement which requires justification, called a **proof**.
	- A proof is an argument taking you from something you know to be true, to something you want to show to be true.
	- It demonstrates that what you know implies what you want to show.
	- e.g. Among 3 straight lines, there are at most 3 points where lines intersect.
		- 3 pairs of lines. By axiom 1, each of these pairs intersects in at most 1 point. Hence there are at most three points where 3 straight lines can intersect.

*Theorems build upon other theorems; proof of new theorems rarely refer directly to axioms. It's like a brick tower where the foundation is the axioms and the walls are the theorems. You can trace a theorem from the top to the axioms that help prove it.*
