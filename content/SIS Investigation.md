1. Place the dynamics trolley witihn the trolley board, and position the board on top of a table so that so that the short side of the board meets the end of the table.
2. Place the foam mat below the table, such that it is in front of the short side of the trolley board.
3. Weigh 8 slotted masses (slotted masses, trolley, etc.) using the scale. Record the masses.
4. Slot the 8 masses into the slotted mass carrier.
5. Using a thin string, link the trolley to the slotted weights. Ensure enough length so that the masses can fall to the bottom of the mat with the trolley near the end of the short side of the trolley board.
6. Set up the pulley so that the string will rest on the pulley. Ensure the pulley in position to face the middle of the trolley. 
7. Pull the trolley back until the slotted masses are at the same height as the bottom of the pulley.
8. With someone holding the trolley, position a phone so that the pulley and the foam mat can be seen. Start recording a video.
9. After confirming the number of slotted masses is correct, drop the trolley.
10. When the slotted masses have hit the foam mat, stop recording.
11. If the string has detached, reattach it to both the slotted masses and the trolley. 
12. Place the trolley back on the trolley board. 
13. Repeat steps 6-12 to give 3 videos.
14. Repeat step 13 8 times, each time removing one of the masses and securing it onto the centre of the trolley. This should yield 3 videos for 9 different slotted mass configurations, ranging from 8 to 0 slotted masses.
