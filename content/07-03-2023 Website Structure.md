Cut into two cause stoopid canvas cant load while zoomed out for some reason


Well, this was the initial plan. 3 types of notes, increasing in organisation


## As of: 07-03-2023

So I've been experimenting with this whole thing. I like having R- notes, but not anything else. I feel that R- notes, while they are unpolished, they are organic. 

### What does this mean for published notes?
- Don't worry. Published notes **will** probably be made, but only for a select few topics that I will write in preparation for an assessment or something
