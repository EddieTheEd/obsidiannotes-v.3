*please man i just want a smooth pen for chem*

## Preface

This is where I shall document my spiritual journey and awakening with the pens I used.

## 1. Sharpie S Gel 0.7mm
This was where it all began. Upon using this pen for the first time, my mind was blown. All my life, I thought pens were meant to be pressed firmly into the paper. But writing with this pen was truly a turning point in my life. The ink flowed like water, and my writing speed doubled. The only downside was, it was too large. While my writing speed doubled, my handwriting (which was already atrocious) halved in quality. From an outside perspective, one could see that my low average in chem was directly proportional to the quality of my handwriting (lets ignore that it was primarily cause i was lazy). This sparked a search for a finer pen size, i.e. 0.5 or 0.38mm, but alas, Sharpie is American, and such finer pen tips were only found in the land of freedom. Furthermore, the 0.7mm was **incredibly blotchy**. Like seriously, I'd write a single line and my right hand would become blackened instantly. This was a major let-down for me, and I couldn't handle having my writing become unreadable if I accidentally slid my finger across the letters.

## 2. Muji Smooth Gel Ink Pen 0.38mm
This was an *interesting* pen. While my handwriting certainly got better, this pen lacked the free-flowing ability of the Sharpie pens. In fact, one could say that the pen was rather scratchy, as it felt so resistant and produced such a thin line. Overall, this pen does hold a soft spot in my heart as it got me through sem 2 of yr 10. 

## 3. Muji Smooth Gel Ink Pen 0.5mm
Now this was a significant upgrade. This pen allowed my handwriting to be "reasonably" good (my mother would say otherwise), and like all Muji ink pens, was relatively smooth. This pen felt like perfect, but I was longing for something more. I missed the free-flowing of the Sharpie pen, but also wanted it to have a relatively medium (0.50mm) pen tip.

## 4. Pentel Energel 0.4mm ball Needle Point + Pop Urban 0.7mm ball pen
You may ask "What the hell is Pop Urban"? Well, first, popular. No, not the adjective, the store in many Asian countries! Popular  supplies a brand, "Pop Urban". I'm now just realising that they probably own this pen brand. Anyways, despite being 0.7mm, the ink produced was vivid and sharp, and was almost as smooth as the Sharpie pen. Hence, I used it in conjunction with the Pentel pen. Now this pen was quite like the Muji 0.38 one. Incredibly sharp, but very smooth as well. Problem is, the Pop Urban pens only come from Popular, and the Pentel pen is like $6 per pen, which is absolutely ridiculous. So, the journey continues for the perfect pen. And I think I'm on to something. Here's to the future.
