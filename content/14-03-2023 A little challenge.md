hello hello

so i have a challenge for YOU
b

but you gotta promise me

dont look at the commit history
cause that ruins the whole challenge

i have hidden an mp3 file somewhere here

if you find it and send it to me via discord i will give you a prize


dont cheat

i will make a judgement of your morality to determine whether you did it legitimately or not

this may come in a form of some explanation on how the clues here lead to the solution
