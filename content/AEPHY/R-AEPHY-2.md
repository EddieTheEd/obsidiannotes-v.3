## Vectors!!! Woo yeah
- Scalar quantities:
	- Fully defined by magnitude only
	- e.g. Time, Distance, Speed
		- Distance: total length of path traveled going from A - B, vs Displacement: straight-line distance between A - B
- Vector quantities:
	- Fully defined by having a magnitude and **direction**
		- When calculating vectors, remember to **add direction!!!!!!!!!**
			- Exception: Q asks for the **magnitude** of vector.
	- e.g. Displacement, Velocity, Acceleration, Jerk

### Measurements for scalars and vectors
- Displacement is **abreviated to s!!**(same as **distance**) directionYou may put an arrow on top of it to indicate it is a vector quantity($\vec{s}$) (meters)
- Velocity + speed : v ($ms^{-1}$)
- Acceleration: a ($ms^{-2}$)
- Force: F (Newtons, N)
- Work: W, **Work = $F_{s}$**, (N (????))
	- $E_{k} = \frac{1}{2} mv^{2}$
	- $E_{p} = mgh$
	- Energy is in **joules** (J)

## Free Body Diagrams vs Vector diagrams

Free Body Diagram: Shows all the real forces acting on a body
| Abbreviation        | Force                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| W                   | Weight Force/Gravitational force |
| Lift                | N/A                              |
| Drag/Air resistance | N/A                                 |

Vector diagrams: Shows **forces** only, centered on a dot.
- Must have the same vector quantity
- ON each side
- Must be resolved 
	- i.e. 2m East, 3m West, The resultant vector would be 1m

- **Define own compass direction (for relevant questions)**
- Head to tail
