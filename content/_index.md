## HEY
TAJ GO BE ORIGINAL FOR A CHANGE DONT CC MY WEBSITE

## v.3
*all rise for the ascension of obsidiannotes-v.3, reborn from the ashes of the past and its failures. hours of tinkering with makefiles, deploy.yaml and the likes, only to CHANGE A SINGLE BUTTON ON THE GITHUB REPOSITORY FROM "Read repository contents and packages permissions" to "Read and write permissions" and it FINALLY WORKS. This is evidenced by the 15 failed commits before i finally got it to work.*

*with the rise of a new obsidian notes version comes an announcement.The website shall be be reorganized into **~~the first Galactic Empire~~** a more efficient system using folders!!!! Please stand by as i find out how to make the whole folder sitch look less ugly :)*

## Hello!

Welcome to my website! I'm [Ed](about.md), and this website is essentially **Obsidian Publish on steroids**, i.e. *this is where I publish my obsidian notes*. 

The website runs using **Github pages** and **Quartz**, with special thanks to Jacky Zhao [(here is the github page)](https://github.com/jackyzha0), who essentially wrote all the code, did all the hard work, while I've just stolen it. :)

And this is my [website philosophy](20-12-2022%20Website%20Philosophy). Enjoy :)

Please see [notes](notes.md) or [writings](Writings.md), this is where all the stuff is :)

## Tips and Tricks

- **All current notes *should* be available at** [notes](notes.md) 
- You may also wish to peruse through some sister-sites of this website, which I wholly recommend you do. Especially *"spicata"*'s one. You'll find them all [here](https://notes-coalition.github.io/).
	- UPDATE: I no longer associate my website with the one owned by "M.Spicata", he has become too jzhao. I like jzhao. I would  love to be him. However he has gone too far. "M.Spicata" has lost his identity and become entirely jzhao. He has memorised his bloody lifestyle and looked at his finances. This is deeply concerning. Not poggers. - Ed
		- UPDATE UPDATE: Having seen the amogus that rests dormant on "M.Spicata"'s index page, I am now happily associating with him once again. Sending digital love and smiley faces. - Ed ඞ
- I recommend looking through the [Topic Notes](AECHE%20Topic%20Notes.md) above all, as most of the [Class Notes](AECHE%20Class%20Notes.md) are unformatted, and the [Published Notes](AECHE%20Published%20Notes.md) is looking quite barren. Please note however, I am yet to fully transition to a topic-style system when writing notes, so most of the topic notes have nothing in them. Do check out [Electron Configuration](Electron%20Configuration.md), I think its the only one with stuff.
- The *Table of Contents* section for all the class notes will be pretty scuffed.  Kindly ignore them.

## IMPORTANT!

This website is in the development stage. There will definitely be some unformatted pages, and the whole thing is rather experimental. Check out the development status [here](Development%20Status.md)!
