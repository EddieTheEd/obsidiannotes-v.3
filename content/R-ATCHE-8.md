**Bold** - Specific to the question
*Italics* - Phrases to note

**Suppose the concentration of $NO_{2}$ is increased**. There are more $NO_{2}$ particles *per unit volume*, and more collisions between more$NO_{2}$ particles occur. A *higher frequency* of successful collisions occur, and the forward rate is initially higher, as the reverse rate is initially unchanged, *since there is no initial change in product concentration*. More products are produced than consumed, so the product concentrations rise *and so the reverse reaction rate increases*. More reactants are consumed than produced, so the reactant concentrations fall *and so the forward reaction rate decreases*. This occurs until the rates are equal, and equilibrium is re-established *having shifted right.*
