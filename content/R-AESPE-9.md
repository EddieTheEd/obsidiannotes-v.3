## Example Question

You can paddle a canoe at 5 km/h in still water and you want to cross a river which is $50m$ wide. The river is flowing at $3km/h$.

If you start from A and paddle directly towards the opposite bank, find the resultant velocity, the time taken to reach the bank and how far you are from B when you arrive.

- Construct a right angled triangle to represent the vector force
- Notice that since the distance to the bank is $50m$, this means there exists a similar triangle between the two opposite points of the bank and the point we land on
	- Hence, the distance between B and the point we land on is proportional to $3km/h$. We know $5km/h => 50m$, hence $d=30m$


Complex but important way to find time:
- Find out the resultant vector.
- Find the distance between A to that point we land on
- Hence, we know distance, we know speed (in the same direction!! important!)

Why can this be cheesed?
- River flows perpendicular to the river.
- Hence, when you construct the diagram, you notice that it has **no effect on the vertical vector**.
- That is to say, the rate at which we travel **vertically** is the same regardless of how strong the river pushes **horizontally**.

## What if we must land at point B?
