## Death to Copyright

I don't like copyright.

I guess I'm fine with the whole commercial copyright, people gotta be incentivised to make stuff. And copyright ensures that their invention will keep their coffers full till they drop dead.

But I am wholly against the copyright of educational resources. 

History has shown that societal progress and all the benefits of such progress (higher standard of living, greater opportunity, in particular *cool science things*) is driven by innovation. But to be innovative requires a strong understanding of the field you are trying to innovate in. In a rather massive, impersonal society such as ours, The only way to provide such understanding to a young population is via education. 

Thus, my position is that education is the most crucial resource to a society, as it pulls us forwards into the future.

But educational copyright, as I like to call it, puts restraints on the accessibility of education. Quite obviously, when we put a paywall on higher education, we disadvantage those who cannot afford it.

Hence, the goal of this website is to make my knowledge free and accessible. I can't write a book and then make it free, that would be rather expensive. So I guess this is the next best option.

## Become big brain

This website is made using Obsidian. I have an Obsidian vault with Obsidian Git that pulls the funny md pages to github, which then converts it into a website format via Hugo, the last part is thanks to Quartz :)

Anyways, I use Obsidian cause Christian Choe told me it will make me big brain.

I've used it for almost a year, but I don't feel that my brain has become bigger. Nevertheless, I have faith. 

I have a dream.

That I'll finally create a simplistic and user-friendly labelling system for my notes.

From there, my brain will truly become massive.
