## Pascals Triangle
Pascal triangle cool
- $nCr= n-1Cr-1 + n-1Cr$ - An element of pascal's triangle is equal to the sum of the 2 elements above it
- $nCr = nCn-r$ - Symmetry of the triangle


### Subsets of a set:
- The number of subsets of a set of size n is $2^n$.
- This means that the sum of the entries in row $n$ of Pascal's triangle is $2^n$.
