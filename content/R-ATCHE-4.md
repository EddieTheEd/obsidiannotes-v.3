## Reversible vs Non-reversible reactions

Most reactions have an energy profile diagram such that the activation energy for both the forward and reverse reaction are reasonably low, and close to each other.

The reactions that don't are considered **non-reversible**, such that the forward(could be reverse, depends how you look at it) reaction is so much more favourable than the reverse so it occurs to completion. This is because the reverse reaction has too high of an activation energy to occur.
