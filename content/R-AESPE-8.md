## Why is it important?
- Very significant in yr 12 course, but this time in yr 12 its in 3 dimensions, compared to 2 dimensions for yr 11

## A quick overview

- **A vector** is a quantity with magnitude and direction.
	- This distinguishes it from being an ordinary number in mathematics.
- A measurement of distance for example is not a vector quantity, it is just a scalar (a number(purely magnitude))
- A measurement of distance and direction(displacement) is a vector quantity.


- Ways of representing vectors
- Specification of magnitude and direction e.g. 10km at 030$\degree$
- An arrow(usually drawn roughly to scale)
- Component form

### A sidenote
- Sadler 3A contains basically bearing questions, where you need to use non-right triangle trigonometry.

e.g.
A boat sails 15 km on a bearing 170$\degree$ followed by 9 km due East. Fine the distance and bearing of the boat's final position from its initial position.

- Sadler 3B is when you must obtain a resultant force vector from two force vectors acting together.

e.g. two forces act on a weight as shown. Find the resultant force vector. 


## Sets to work on
- Sadler 3A 3B
	- Suggestion: just the odd questions
