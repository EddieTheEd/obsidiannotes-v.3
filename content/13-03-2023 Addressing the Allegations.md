title: "13-03-2023 Addressing the Allegations"
---

*my good friends*

It has come to my attention that a certain "Grim reaper" has been actively tarnishing my name; dragging it through the sand. He has come out with some rather ridiculous, absurdist, dadaist, and bullish (you know what i mean) statements regarding my website and me. 

These will all be addressed in the following sentences, however, I first wish to unveil the mask of the grim reaper himself.

**The Grim Reaper is Taj van de Klauw!!!**

I will now list the allegations put against me and why they are completely stupid.

## I did not help his website in a "helpful way"

Well yeah. How could I? When I offered to help he undid all my progress cause he wanted to keep the folders intact, even though I told him prior to making the website that folders don't work well. Yet he still complains it doesn't work. 

## My website has a virus

This is just fake news. You can literally check the github for my website, and see it has nothing malicious(to my knowledge, maybe Jzhao has some sketchy stuff hidden inside). Mr van de Klauw is just straight up lying. :(

## I am slandering him

No I am not. I may have briefly told him to be original in my index page but other than that I have not made any other public, defamatory comments. 


## Summary
Taj is cring. He is speaking non-truths. Not cool. But its ok. I forgive :)

*With love(but not for dasindu)*

*Ed*
