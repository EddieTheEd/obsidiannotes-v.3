## Combinatorics 1
### Multiplication Principle

If there are m ways of performing 1 task and n ways of performing another task, then there are $m \times n$ ways of performing both tasks.

### Addition Principle

If there are m ways of performing a specific task, and there are n ways of performing the same task but in another way, then there are $m+n$ ways of completing the tasks.

### Permutations
- A permutation is an ordered arrangement of a set of objects
- When we arrange r objects from a total set of n objects the total number of possible arrangements is given by:
$$
nPr = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
$$
