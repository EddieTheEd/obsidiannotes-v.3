## Quantifiers

These are words or symbols which specify the quantity or existence of something in a mathematical statement.

e.g. 
- **All** square numbers are positive.
- **For all** people in Australia, the equator is to the North.
- **There exists** an even prime numbers
	- There exists: they can be infinitely many, or just one. But there has to be at least one case.
- **For all** real number $x > 0$, **there exists** a real number $z$ where $0<z<x$

### Symbols:
- $\forall$ mean 'for all'
- $\exists$ means 'there exists'
	- Note: in assessments, **don't use these symbols!**

## Proving/Disprohere exists a square prime number.ving statements with quantifiers
- There exists a prime here exists a square prime number.number which is not odd.
- Proof: 2 is even, 2 is prime. 
	- **TLDR: By citing one example is adequate to prove "There exists" statements are *true***
	- However, you need a more rigorous proof to **disprove** something.
- All right triangles are isoceles.
	- To prove this is **true**, you need a rigorous proof. Yet to prove this is **false**, you need just one example.

### Summary
- When dealing with a "There exists" statement,
	- To prove the statement is true, only one example must be provided.
	- To prove the statement is false, a rigorous proof must be provided.
- When dealing with a "All/For all" statement,
	- To prove the statement is true, a rigorous proof must be provided.
	- To prove the statement is false, only one example must be provided.
