## Sets of Numbers

First section of Chapter 6 in Cambridge (pg 44-42?)

There are many proofs
- Direct proofs
- Proof by contradiction
- Proof by exhaustion
- Proof by contrapositive
- Proof by induction

Sets of numbers have symbols
- $\mathbb{N}$: the set of natural numbers {1,2,3,4,5... $\infty$}
- $\mathbb{Z}$: the set of all integers {$-\infty, \dots, -5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0, 1,2,3,4,5, \dots, \infty$}
- $\mathbb{Q}$: the set of all rational numbers (numbers that can be written as $\frac{a}{b}$ where a and b are both integers)
- $\mathbb{R}$: the set of all real numbers (includes all rational and irrational numbers)

See [[Number Sets Notes]]

## Set notation
- $\in$: means "is in" or "is a member of" or "belongs to".
	- e.g. $x \in \mathbb{R}$ this means x is a member of, or is, a real number. It can be 3, it could be $\pi$.
- $\subset$: means "is a subset of".
	- e.g. $\mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{R}$, i.e. all integers are real numbesr.
- $\subseteq$: for a subset where it doesnt completely contain the thing it is a subset of. 

## Conditional Statement
- If a polygon is a quadrilaterial then it has exactly four sides.
	- Stucture makes this a conditional statement, e.g. if -> then
	- If Stated condition, then consequence
	- Doesn't have to be the same structure


- A conditional statement like "If A then B" can be written in math as:
	- $\mathbb{A} \implies \mathbb{B}$

### Proving Conditional Statement
- When proving such a statement ($A \implies B$) you are proving a **casual relationship** exists between the **truth o f A** and the **truth of B**.

One can do this by:
1. Assume A is true (entertain **hypothetical possibility**), then show B must follow to be true as a consequence.

e.g. Prove If $n$ is divisible by 7, then $n^2$ is divisible by 49.
#### Proof
Assume that $n$ is divisible by 7. 
Thus $n=7m$ where $m \in \mathbb{Z}$.
So $n^{2}= (7m)^{2} = 7^{2}m^{2} = 49m^{2}$
Since $m^2$ is an integer, $n^2$ is thus divisible by 49
**QED** (dont forget this lol)

### Odd + Even Integers

When working with even integers, write as $2k, k \in \mathbb{Z}$

When working with odd integers, write as $2k + 1, k \in \mathbb{Z}$

If you need to **show** that a number is **even**, then you should show that it can be written as $2k, k \in \mathbb{Z}$

If you need to **show** that a number is **odd**, then you should show that it can be written as $2k + 1, k \in \mathbb{Z}$.
