yea these are the pieces i hope to do (or am doing)

will only do grade 8 for now, cbb write my grade 7 ones

## Grade 8

- Chopin: Marche Funebre - op 72 no 2 in C minor
- Grieg: Wedding Day at Troldhaugen No 6 from Lyric Pieces Op 65 in D major
	- If i am unable to convince my teacher, then I will settle for the funny Norwegian Dance - op 35 no 2 A major
		- I will show up to Ms Younger's class and play this and it will be so funny and hilarious and awesome
		- Upon second thought I will probably lead with this
- Tchaikovsky: Romance in F minor Op 5
	- Probably Valse Sentimentale cause that bops
- Debussy: Valse romantique L 71

I realise I can't do all of them. Since there's a "3 from the list, 2 of own choice" but like yea I bet some of them are on the lists if not all of them

and i'll find some random piece to be my fifth
