## Acids and Bases

- Acids: ionic solids that ionise in aqueous solution to produce H+
- Bases: ionic solids that dissociate to produce hydroxide in aqueous solution

This is Arrhenius theory, and its actually really bad and limited!

TLDR, why is ammonia basic? UI says so, but it does not produce OH-.

1. Some substances behave as bases, such as ammonia even though they do not produce OH- ions
2. Only applies to acids and bases in water, does not account for acidic or basic behaviours in solid and liquids

## New Mode: Bronsted Lowry
1. An acid is any **species** that donates protons
2. A base is any **species** that accepts protons.

Compared to Arrhenius, **this explains more acidic/basic substances!!!**

## Cute Comparison
Redox: transfer of electrons
Acid base: transfer of protons

### Distinguish from Yr 11
Before: $HCl \rightleftharpoons H^{+}+ Cl^{-}$
After: $HCl + H_{2}O \rightleftharpoons H_{3}O^{+}+Cl^{-}$
- Hydronium ion must be formed cause funny dipole dipole things
- Needs state symbols, was just too lazy to write them in latex.
	- I wrote that with only my left hand
		- I wrote that with only my left hand !!
			- Where is my right hand? Holding up my head because I am bored and tired
				- I wrote that with only my left hand!

Advantages:
- Explains why certain solids are basic without containing OH-
- Can explain ionic species, not must molecules
- Can compare acid vs conjugate base
- Clarifies the role of water taking place in reactions of  acid-base. E.g. Hydronium ion is formed rom acid when water accepts H+
- Can explain why certain salts are acidic/basic

Disadvantages:
- It can explain thereactions between acidic oxides and basic oxides, which take place even in the absence of solvent (water).
- Funny electron transfer alongside protons which is not needed


## Definitions for Bronsted Lowry
- Conjugate acid: the product of a base which has acquired an extra proton, which it can donate in the reverse reaction. 
- Conjugate base: the product of an acid which  has donated a proton and thus can accept a proton in the reverse reaction.

- A strong acid is any acid that ionises completely in solutions to produce hydrogen ions. This means it gives off the greatest number of hydrogen ions or ptrotons when placed in a solution
- A weak acid is any acid that only ionsies partially in solton
- A strong base is any base that compeltely dissociates in solution to produce hydroxide ions
- A week base is any base that only partially dissociates in solution to produce hydroxide ions
Remember acids ionises while bases dissociate.
**Representations in equation**
- Strong things are forward 
- Weak are eqi

- Dilute and concentrated are *comparative terms* that describe the concentration of a solute in solution
- Dilute mixtures are mixtures where a relatively small amount of solute id dissolved in a given volume of solvent
- Concentrated mixtures are mixtures where a relatively large amount of solute is dissolved in a given concentration

Hence, Dilute/Concentrated are not the same as Strong/Weak, as strong/weak refer to the extent to which a substance acts as an acid/base, whereas concentration is a measure of the **amount of** acid/base *per unit volume* in a solution.

## Dissociation Constant
- The equilibrium constant applied in an acid/base environment.
e.g. for the reaction $HA + H_{2}O \rightleftharpoons H_{3}O^{+}+A^-$

$K_{a} = \frac{[H_{3}O^+][A^-]}{[HA]}$

It follows that for **strong acids**, the $K_{a}$ is **very high!**
Similarly, for **weak acids**, the $K_{a}$ is **very low!**

This means, the $K_{a}$ can tell us the strength of the acid.

Remember the definition of a strong acid, cause its important!
- When it has a $K_{a}\geq 1$

Similarly the weak acid:
- When it has a $K_{a} \leq 1$

(Presumably at standard conditions, i.e. 25 $\degree$C 1 molL$^{-1}$(of the acid in question, not the products obviously))

Just remember that when we look for the **reverse reaction** of an acid ionisation, the $K_{a}$ is the **reciprocal** of what it would be for the *forward reaction*. 


## Amphoteric
- Substances that can act as either an acid or a base
- Usually the main examples are:
	- Water
	- Acids that have lost a few protons, but are polyprotic (e.g. $HSO_{4}^{-}$)

## Polyprotic
- Specific acids that are capable of losing more than a single proton per molecule in acid-base reactions. IN other words, acids that have more than one ionisable H+ atom per molecule.
	- *Monoprotic*: e.g. HNO3, HCl
	- *Diprotic*: e.g. H2SO4
	- *Triprotic*: e.g. H3PO4

## Important thing about Polyprotic
- The acid strength of each subsequent ionisation decrease as the number of hydrogens remaining decrease.
- For example, take sulfuric acid.
Sulfuric acid is a strong acid, hence it donates the first proton almost always, to **produce $HSO_{4}^{-}$**.

But to donate the final one, it is harder.

Why?
- In the second stage, it goes from -1 to -2. I.e. it gets more neutral. Hence, as all things want to be neutral, it finds it harder to lose the proton and become more negative
	- Similarly, since it is now negative, it is attracting protons, hence the molecule will keep if not attract more protons.

### TLDR
The acid dissociation constant decreases with consecutive ionisations of a polyprotic acid.


## Acidic Properties of Salt
- A salt is an ionic compound comprising on an anion and cation.

- In a dilute aquoeous solution, salts ar ecompletedly dissociated into their respective ions as they are strong electrolytes (unless insoluble)
- These dissociated ions **may undergo hydrolysis**. This is a chemical reaction of a dissociated ion and water, resulting in the ion acting as **either an acid or base**.

Neutral ions
- Group 1 and Group 2
- Conjugate Negative ions of strong acids, e.g. Cl- Br-

Form acidic
- Conjugate positive ions of **weak bases**, e.g. NH4+, HSO4-
- Group 13 transition metal ions that are **polyvalent** e.g. Al3+, Fe3+

Form basic
- Conjugate negative ions of **weak acids**, e.g. CH3COO-, F-, etc.


- Salts of strong acid and strong base
	- A neutral salt will be produced
	- Conjugate acids derived from strong acids
		- Anions such as Cl- have a low tendency to react with water to from HCl- and OH-, and are thus considered neutral
		- This is known because hte Ka value for the strong acid is very high, and so the Ka value for these anions in the reverse reaction is very very low
	- Conjugate cations dervied from strong ases
		- Conjugate cations ike Na_ have a lower tendency to react with water to form NaOh and H3O+, as they are wek acids, and are thus considered neutral.
		- This is known because the Ka value for the strong base is very high and so the Ka value for these cations is very very low.
- Salts of strong acid and **weak** base
	- When a strong base and a weak base react, an acidic salt is produced. This is because cation is acidic, i.e. it donates a H+ in solution, whereas the anion does not undergo hydrolysis.
	- Conjugate Anions derived from strong acids:
		- Anions such as Cl- have a low tendency to react with water to form Hcl and Oh- and are thus considreed neutral.
		- This is known because the ka value for the strong acid is very high, and so the Ka value for these anions is very very low
	- Conjugate cations derived from weak bases
		- Conjugate cations like NH4+ have a high tendency to donate protons as they are strong conjugate acids of a weak base, and are thus considered acidic.
		- This is known because the ka value for th weak base is very low,and so the ka value for these cations is very high.
- Salt of weak acid and strong base
	- When a weak acid and a strong base react, a basic salt is produced. This is because anion undergoes hydrolysis to decrease the H+ concentration, whereas the cation does not undergo hydrolysis.
	- Conjugate anions derived from weak acids:
		- Anions such as Ch3Coo- have  high tedency to react with water ti accept a H+, and are thus considered basic.
			- This is known because the Ka value for the weak acid is very very low hence the Ka for the conjugate base is very very very high
- Salt of weak acid and weak base
	- I cbb write, nothing happens use ur brain

## Acid Base properties of unique salts
- Hydrolysis of polyprotic acids
	- Anions that contain acidic hydrogen atoms are deried from polyprotic acids and are able to undergo a separate hydrolysis reaction that produces either H+ or OH- in solution
	- These are competing hydrolysis reactions, whether the anions exhibits acidic or basic behaviours will depend on the extent of each hydrolysis equations
	- You **must memorise** that HSO4- are better proton donors than they are proton acceptors, and so they are **acidic**, similarly CH3COO- is a weak base and so it is basic.

Hydrolysis of Group 13 aquated metal ions
- The +3 ions that are formed from group +3 metals (semi-metals) as well as many +2, +3, +4 transition metals produce acidic salts in aqueous solution
- These small highly positive charged ions attract water molecules to themselves formed a hydrated shell with the main IMF being ion-dipole forces between thecation and the lone electron pair of the water molecules
- These hydrated metal ions can then act as a bronsted lowry acid as one of the water molecules in the hydrated shell can donate its H+
	- This is stupid and very complicated, so no need to draw equations!
