title: "English Podcast Transcript Brainstorm"
---

NOTE: THIS IS ALL IN 5 MINUTES
Perhaps we have a guest speaker to talk about immigration policies in Australia.

This is going to be an excerpt of a podcast episode. 

So **half** of this [Political podcast transcript](Political%20podcast%20transcript.md).


Start off with a recorded message from a politician?

Rough template:

1. Politician recording
2. Host asks guest speaker (probably someone Vietnamese) about what they think about it
3. Personal anecdote
4. *Quote from Hoda Afshar (Writer)'s [Reflections on Australia's Immigration policy](Reflections%20on%20Australia's%20Immigration%20policy.md), or reference to [Operation Sovereign Borders policy](Operation%20Sovereign%20Borders%20policy.md)*
5. Show picture of immigrants
6. Insert 'greatest moments' here
7. Some attack on bad evil politician guy 
8. Fin.

Rough Script:
