## Acid Bases Continued

just kidding i got a booklet, this is on pause

Non-Metal Oxides
- Non-metal oxides e.g. NO2 CO2 react with water to produce the respective oxyacid (oxygen containing acid)
- THe acid formed then ionises to produce H3O+ ions thus increasing their concentration and thus lowering pH.

Metal Oxides and Metal Hydroxides
- Metal oxides react with water (hydrolysis) to produce a metal hydroxide - this metal hydroxide dissociates to produce hydroxide ions
- The hydroxide ions neutralise hydronium ions and thus increase the solution pH. This means that the Metal oxides are basic.

## Autoionisation of Water

We know $K_{W}=1\times 10^{-14}$ at $25\degree C$.

- Exercise for the reader: LCP explanation for changed temp on autoionisation of water
- **An increased temperature results in an increased Kw**.

## Neutralisation

- Neutralisation is a chemcial reaction in which an acid and a base react with each other such that there is NO EXCESS of hydronium ions OR hydroxide ions present in the solution - thus the aqueous solution is considered NEUTRAL because \[OH\] = \[H+\].
- However, the pH of the neutralised solution depends on the acid strength of the reactants. 
- Say we have a solution of a weak acid and strong base.If there is 1molL solution of strong base, to neutralise this base solution we need to **still add 1mol of the weak acid**. *DO NOT THINK "we have to add extra amounts of the weak acid to neutralise the strong base"*.

- **You must always add stoichiometrically equal moles of acid (to base, and vice versa) to achieve complete neutralisation**.

### Equivalence point
- In solutions of weak acid, at equilibrium, the concentration of the ACID MOLECULE is greater than the concentration of the conjugate base/hydronium
- However, as the strong base is added to the weak acid solution, the hydroxide ions are in excess as compared to the hydronium and so the hydronium is completely neutralised. By Le Chatelier's Principle - the system re-establishes equilibrium by partially counteracting the decrease in H3O+. Thus is favours the ionisation reaction of the weak acid.
- This continues to occur as long as more and more of the *strong base* is added - at one point, there is no more weak acid left. it is at THIS POINT that the molecules of hydroxide added exactly equals the maximum moles of H3O+ that could be produced, and thus stoichiometrically equal amounts of strong base have to be added to the weak acid for complete neutralisation
- Vice versa for weak base and strong acid.

### Question Type 8 - Neutralisation of Weak Acids/Bases
*Weak acids like ethanoic acid are only partially ionised when dissolved in water. For this reason a 1.00 molL-1 ethanoic acid solution has a H+ concentration of around 0.89 molL-1. Given this fact, explain why then 1.00molL-1 of NaOH is required to neutralise a 1.00molL-1 ethanoic acid solution. Support your answer by writing a suitable reaction equation and by employing Le Chatelier's Principle.*
- In solution the ethanoic acid exists 


## Buffers
- Definition: A buffer solution is one that is able to resist changes in its pH when proportionally small quantities of an acid or base are added to it.
- Requirements:
	- Buffer solutions contain a **weak acid and its conjugate base or weak acid and its conjugate acid**
	- Buffer solutions work because:
		- The weak acid and weak base can co-exist in solution without neutralising (as they barely react with water and thus remain in high concentration)
		- The weak acid can still react to neutralise small quantities of strong acid/base added
	- There needs to be a high concentration of both weak acid/CB and weak acid/CA; this is so it can resist changes in pH when either base or acid are added.
	- Buffers work best when there is an equal concentration of weak acid and base.

### Producing Buffers
There are two main ways a buffer can be produced.

Take the following buffer:
$H_{2}O + CH_{3}COOH \rightleftharpoons CH_{3}COO^{-}+H_{3}O^{+}$

Method 1: Mix weak acid with salt:
- Acetic acid is a weak acid so it ionises to a lesser degree than a strong acid. Thus the acetic acid makes the acidic part of buffer. Sodium acetate is a salt and it completely ionises in water and makes the basic part of buffer.
- As you want the quantities of CH3COOH and CH3COONa to be high and equal (for a high buffering capacity): you would add equimolar quantities of ethanoic acid and CH3COONa
	- TLDR **concentrations must be same**

Method 2: Mix weak acid and strong base:
- You would add a **high** concentration of NaOH and CH3COOH in the ratio of 1:2.

**see teachable for continued part**

## Buffer Action

Take the following buffer:
$H_{2}O + CH_{3}COOH \rightleftharpoons CH_{3}COO^{-}+H_{3}O^{+}$

Strong acid added:
- Net effect: When HCl is added to the buffer solution **where the amount does NOT exceed the buffer capacity - the buffer system partially counteracts the pH change.**
- Basic Equilibirum: WHen the HCl is added, H3O+ concentration increases; this causes product concentration to increase and so the reverse reaction rate increases and so as the forward reaction is unaltered, the reverse reaction is favoured. Here ethanoate ion acts as a Bronsted Lowry Base and accepts a proton from water.
- State Shift and change in concentration: Thus , as equilibirum shifts left and the concentration of H3O+ decreases partially.
- Why pH change was minimal: Thus as the icnrease in H3O+ is partially counteracted, the overall increase in the concentration of H3O+ is minimal and so a significant dcrease in pH is resisted.

Strong base added:
- Net Effect: WHen NaOH is added to the buffer solution **where the amount does NOT exceed the buffer capacity - the buffer system partially counteract the pH increase**
- Basic Equilibrium: When the NaOH is added,H3O+ concentration decreases, this causes product concentrations to decrease and so the reverse reaction rate decreases and so as the forward reaction is unaltered, thus the forward reaction rate is favoured. Here ethanoic acid will act as a Bronsted Lowry Acid and donate a proton to water.
- State shift and Change in Concentration: Thus, as equilibrium shifts right the concentration of H3O+ increases partially.
- Why pH change was minimal: Thus, as the decrease in H3O+ is partially counteracted, the overall decrease in the concentration of H3O+ is minimal and so a significant increase in pH is resisted.
