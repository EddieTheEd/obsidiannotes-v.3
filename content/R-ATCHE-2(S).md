## Acid Bases Continued

just kidding i got a booklet, this is on pause

Non-Metal Oxides
- Non-metal oxides e.g. NO2 CO2 react with water to produce the respective oxyacid (oxygen containing acid)
- THe acid formed then ionises to produce H3O+ ions thus increasing their concentration and thus lowering pH.

Metal Oxides and Metal Hydroxides
- Metal oxides react with water (hydrolysis) to produce a metal hydroxide - this metal hydroxide dissociates to produce hydroxide ions
- The hydroxide ions neutralise hydronium ions and thus increase the solution pH. This means that the Metal oxides are basic.

## Autoionisation of Water

We know $K_{W}=1\times 10^{-14}$ at $25\degree C$.

- Exercise for the reader: LCP explanation for changed temp on autoionisation of water
- **An increased temperature results in an increased Kw**.

## Neutralisation

- Neutralisation is a chemcial reaction in which an acid and a base react with each other such that there is NO EXCESS of hydronium ions OR hydroxide ions present in the solution - thus the aqueous solution is considered NEUTRAL because \[OH\] = \[H+\].
