## Defining the Gothic
- Came to prominence in the late 18th century
- Tales of mystery and the supernatural
- often closely linked to horror, but never goes for shock factor. Rather it unsettles us with its transgressive elements
	- Death 
	- Decay
	- Darkness
	- Madness and the human mind
	- Isolation and outsiders
	- Monsters and the monstrous
	- Interest in the old, forgotten, or shunned aspects of human society and culture

## Gothic as a genre
- As a literary genre, Gothic literature aims to confront its readers with all of these uncivilised, fearful, and 'old' things that bubble away beneath society's mask of modern civility.
- Part of its aim is to remind us of the inevitable 'dark side' that remains despite human progress.
