## Force (definition(very important(probably isnt)))


> [!important] Tip
> Definitions are apparently important in physics. Shocker.


**That which causes an object of mass to change in its motion (i.e. changes its velocity) if it is not balanced.**
- Memorise this for physics definitions :(((((((((((((((((((((((((((

## Categories of Forces
|      | contact                 | non-contact                                |
| ---- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| push | shove, kick, punch      | magnetism between same poles               |
| pull | grab, "hug", tug of war | gravity, magnetism between different poles |

## 3 Laws of motion
- 1. An object of **mass**(mass is important here. Objects lacking mass are **not** affected by forces!) will continue in its state of *motion*(could be at rest, being at rest is a "special state of motion") unless acted upon by an unbalanced force
	- N.B. motion = velocity, $\therefore$ speed and/or direction.
- 2. $F = ma$, the acceleration of an object of mass is proportional to the unbalanced force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.
- 3. Every action force has an equal and opposite action force.
	- How do things work at all if this is true?
![[000_Files/000a_images/the legendary hammer and nail diagram from waters.png]]
$F_{1} = -F_{2}$
$m_{1}a_{1} = -(m_{2}a_{2})$

The mass of the nail is smaller so the acceleration is greater. Hence the nail accelerates into the dirt or whatever I think. My teacher is Dr Waters pelase help me
