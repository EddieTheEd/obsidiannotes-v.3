title: "guest articles?"
---

to anyone reading this (but directed towards edward),

yes. i am suggesting this to edward using a github pull request.

i believe that cooperation can make our world run better that it does already. and i'm sure that you are able to see that it can work to do that too. when all of us put our heads together, we can achieve great things. build cities, skyscrapers, societies. a lot of... admittedly... dumb people can work together to create something grand. this is what biologists call "emergence".

i too, believe that our little "town" can become grand. however, what good would it do if our websites stay isolated from each other? if this continues, we are only sister websites in name. nothing actually binds our websites together except saying that we are "working together" on our index pages. and so i suggest a new idea that is actually very old. a little thing called guest articles.

in fact, i am doing it right now. by telling you this through a pull request, and if you accept, by a guest article pushing for guest articles on your website. we can tie our websites closer together. the other option for creating a more closely knit community would be creating a "hub note", but you already know the ending to that. it just doesn't work.

but how would these guest articles work? well, imagine we have come up with a conversation topic X. instead of the viewers having to go from and to each website to get a slice of X, we simply designate X to someone's website, and when we have something to add, we add it to their website. of course, you can backlink to your website, like how i am going to do at the bottom of the page. we stop fragmentation, and we add cohesion.

of course, feel free to deny the pull request if you want. but do it if you wish.
